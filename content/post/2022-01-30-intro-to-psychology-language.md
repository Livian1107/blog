- Phonology

- Morphology: morpheme = the smallest meaningful unit

    How many words do we know -> How many morphemes do we know

- Syntax: sentence = noun + verb + noun
 
 ### Language Development Timetable
 18 months 
1. Learning words faster
2. Two word sentences
3. Function morphemes (in, of, a, the)
