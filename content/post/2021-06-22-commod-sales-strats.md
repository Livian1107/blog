### Fixed Income 
> Fixed amount of money returned, provided you get your money back at all
- Use of bonds to finance government
- Use of yields to compate bonds
- Government bond yield as reference points

### The roots of the bond market
Fixed income - fancy word for borrowing and lending

interest rate, inflation

Government bond market

used for War, justice, then healthcare, education

When the government is taking in less tac than it is spending, causing a budget deficit. 

Piggy bank -> US fedral

People use US bond as asset to reserve the value. It has been considered one of the world's main safe havens for investors as they are backed by US
taxpayers, and the US government could ultimately print money to repay them. The mere fact that an investment is denominated in dollars
does not make it safe.

Two reasons that companies borrow in the corporate market:
1. A discrepancy in tax treatment means that debt repayments lower a company's tax bill by reducing pre-tax profits through 
interest payments. As there is a corporation tac on company profits of over 20% in mamy advanced economies, being financed with 
debt saves a company money
2. Companies can borrow money for longer terms from the bond market than from banks, which are not typically keen on making long-term
loans to corporations.

Individual bonds: coupon - regular fixed amount payments, principal - a large payment at the end of the loan

APR: annual percentage rate -> yield

Summary:
- Fixed income is another word for the bond market, where loan agreements are bought and sold
- The term fixed income stems from the fixed nature of bond repayments
- The growth of governments has been the main factor giving rise to the $101T world bond market
- Investos view US government bonds as the safest, most liquid financial assets in the world
- There are millions of bonds outstanding and investors use yields to compare one bond to another

### Bond valuation
bond yield: the interest rate on an equivalent bank account for the furation of the bond

bond valuation drivers:
- Credit Risk:
 - Credit risk factors: Debt/GDP, Deficit/GDP, Repayment schedule
 - Credit tisk indicators: credit rating, credit default swaps
- Macroeconomics: shot-term interest rates, inflation

When bond investors (lender) begin to doubt the creditworthiness of a borrower,
yields move sharply upwards.

- The higher a government's debt burden in proportion to its GDP, the risker its bonds.
For higher risk, investors will demand a higher return in the form of an elevated yield. There is
no general rule on when bond yields will spike. 

- The higher the deficit as a percentage of GDP, the higher the rate at which the government is racking up new debt.
This means that the interest payments go up as a proportion of the governmetn budget. Investors will demand a higher yield to compensate
for the elevated risk.

Summary:
- A bond yield is just the interest rate on an equivalent bank account for the duration of the bond.
- The three biggest factors driving bond yields are the creditworthiness of the borrower, inflation, and short-term interst rates.
- The bond market instills discipline in governments as declining creditworthiness makes future borrowing more expensive.
- Short-term borrowing is cheaper but riskier for borrowers than long-term borrowing as it relies on the ongoing appetite of lenders.
- As repayments to bondholders are fixed, inflation will corrode the purchasing power of fixed bond repayments, sending yields up.
- As U.S. government bond yields serve as benchmarks for all inverments, yields on other bonds tend to move with them.
