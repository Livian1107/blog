* Behavior patterns are like a toolbox. All types are needed. Depending on the occasion, a tool can sometimes be right and sometimes
be wrong.
* No matter how strange it might seem, in theory, every kind of behavior is normal
  Normal Behavior:
  * is relatively predictable
  * is part of a pattern
  * is changeable
  * can be observed
  * is understandable
  * is unique
  * is excusable

#### Why Are We the Way We Are?
* Behvior is a combination of heredity and environment. 
* The temperament and character traits we have inherited affect our behavior, a process already begun
at the genetic stage. Not only do we inherit traits from our own parents but also from their parents - also in varying
degrees from other relatives.

Formula: 
Behavior = f(P x Sf)
* Behavior is a function of Personality and Surrounding factors
* Behavior is that which we can observe
* Personality is what we try to figure out
* Surrounding factors are things that we have an influence on

Conclusion: We continually affect one another in some form or other. The trick is to try to figure out
what's there, under the surface.
