##### What is in-place soring?
Use constant extra space for producing the output by modifying
the given array only. 

E.g. Insertion sort, selection sort.
(Merge sort and counting sort are not)

##### What are internal & external sorting?
External sorting: when all data that needs to be sorted cannot be placed
in-memory at a time. Used for massive amount of data. 

E.g. merge sort and its variations.

Internal soring: when all data is placed in-memory.

##### What is stable sorting?
Stability is mainly important when we have key value pairs
with duplicate keys possible, and we wish to sort these
objects by keys. A soring algorithm is stable if two objects
with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output
as they appeat in the input array to be sorted.

* When equal elements are indistinguishable (with integers), or
any data where the entire element is the key, stability is not 
an issue. Vice versa, if all keys are different.

> Stable sorting: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Count Sort

> Unstable sorting: Quick Sort, Heap Sort can be made stable by taking
the position of elements into considertaion.

> Any comparison based sorting algorithm which is not stable by nature
can be modified to be stable by changing the key comparison operation.
