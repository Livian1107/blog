Perception of brightness, object, depth

### Attention
sensory input -> | sensory memory: unattended information is quickly lost | ->
attention -> | short term memory: unrehearsed information is quickly lost | ->
encoding -> | long term memory: some information is lost over time |
  
Somtimes attention is effortless.

Stroop effect: colorful words of color name with different color on the word

Perception of the world -> attention -> memory
