### Pricing the derivatives
* Arbitrage 套利
* Replication
* Risk neutrality

Present value of discounted cash flow (DCF) 未来现金流折现求和

The value of the financial asset = Expected future price + interim payments (e.g. dividends or coupon interest, discounted at a rate appropriate for the risk assumed)
E(St) + interim cash inflow (dividends) - interim cash outflow 

* Arbitrage空手套白狼：law of one price
Buy Low Sell High, exploit the arbitrage opportunity quickly, then make the prices converge

1. no risk
2. no investment无初始投资

Law of one price: assets that produce identical future cash flows

* Replication
An asset and hedging position of derivatives on the asset 

Asset + Derivative = Risk-free asset
Asset - Risk-free asset = -Derivative
Long asset, short bond, long forward
