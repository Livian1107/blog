### Big questions about development
Morality, continuity, knowledge (empiricism: based on experience, nativism: innate rather than acquired by learning, contructivism: construct knowledge rather than just passively take in information)

### Jean Piaget
Theory of cognitive devleopment: children are active thinkers, constantly trying to construct more advanced understandings of the world.

Schemas/schemata, frameworkd that devleop to help organize knowledge

Assimiliation: the process of taking new information or a new experience and fitting it into an existing schema.

Accommodation: the process by which schemas are changed or created in order to fit nw information.

#### Stage Theory:
Stage 1: sensorimotor, age 0-2
- Information is gained through the senses and motor actions
- The child perceives and manipulates but does not reason
- Object permanence is acquired (The understanding that objects exist independent of one's actions or perceptions of them)

Stage 2: preoperational, age 2-7
- Emergence of symbolic thought
- Reasoning develops, but not high level
- Egocentrism
- Lack of the concept of conservation (a careful preservation and protection of something)

Stage 3: concrete operational, age 7-12
- Understanding of mental operations leading to increasingly logical thought
- Less egocentric
- Inability to reason abstractly or hypothetically

Stage 4: formal operational, age 12- adult
- Abstract and scientific reasoning

### Methods for studying infants
Brain scans, sucking, looking
