### Happiness
Happiness is a goal-state animals have evolved to pursue; a ginal that needs to be satisfied.

1. Failure to appreciate day-to-day irrelevance of certain events
2. The logic of the set-point: we adapt to good and bad things
3. The psychological immune system

Happiness is influenced by absolute and relative factors.
