### From the world to the mind
- Proximity
- Similarity
- Closure
- Good continuation
- Common movement
- Good form

Perception of brightness, object, depth

### Attention
sensory input -> | sensory memory: unattended information is quickly lost | ->
attention -> | short term memory: unrehearsed information is quickly lost | ->
encoding -> | long term memory: some information is lost over time |
  
Somtimes attention is effortless.

Stroop effect: colorful words of color name with different color on the word

-> the effect doesn't have impact on the language you don't speak

### Memory
Perception of the world -> attention -> memory

- Implicit memory: stuff you may be knowing unconsciously
- Explicit memory: what you consciously know

- Semantic memory: facts
- Episodic memory: episodes of your life

#### Memory storage
How do you get things into LTM?
1. Depth of processing
2. Mnemonics - tricks, vivid images
3. Understanding

[![TED - Joshua Foer - Feats of memory anyone can do]({https://img.youtube.com/vi/U6PoUg7jXsA/0.jpg})]({https://youtu.be/U6PoUg7jXsA} "TED - Joshua Foer - Feats of memory anyone can do")

Everyone from the memory contest would tell that they just have average memory. However, they've all trained themselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory, using a set of ancient techniques (invented in Greece).

Once upon a time, people invested in their memories, in laboriously furnishing their minds. Over the last millennia, we've invented a series of technologies, from the alphabet, to the codex, the printing press, photography, the computer, the smartphone, that have made it progressively easier and easier for us to externalize our memories, for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity. These techonologies have made our modern world possible, but also changed us.

Elborative encoding: to take information that is lacking in context, in significance, in meaning, and transform it in a more meaningful way, in the light of al the other things. 

Memory Palace: visual, spatial memory. To create this imagined edifice in mind's eye, and populate it with images of things that you want to remember. The crazier, weirder, more bizarre the image is, the more unforgettable it's likely to be.

Great memories are learnt. Our lives are the sum of our memories. how much are we willing to lose from our already short lives, by losing ourselves in our iPhones, by not paying attention to the human being across from us, by being so lazy that we're not willing to process deeply. There are incredible latent in all of us. But if you want to live a memorable life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember.
